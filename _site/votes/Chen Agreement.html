          <p>This agreement refers to a deal between party 1 (Ed) and party 2 (Chen). The stipulations are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="what-chen-gets">What Chen gets</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Continued membership of the town (unless voted out(unlikely though))</li>
  <li>The policies and laws of the town, enacted after the 26th of May 2023 do not <em>necessarily</em> apply to Chen. For example, if a law is passed requiring all town members to put on their index page the phrase “this is an example”, then Chen is not required to do so.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="-what-ed-gets">## What Ed gets</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Christian can not form political parties in the town.</li>
  <li>Christian can no longer run for the office of mayor in the town.
    <ul>
      <li>This status will apply for life, that is he cannot leave the server and then rejoin to absolve him of this status.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
