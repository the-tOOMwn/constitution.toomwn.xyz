# the oom town

We are a town, not really out of memory (OOM) but we like oom.

This was made so we could collaborate on a funni project which links our own separate projects together.

How wholesome, why doesn't the world take note? This is such a poggies example of good foss collaboration and happiness.

No guys I didnt write this late at night while incredibly tired and barely able to read what I am writing.

Trust me guys I'm not communist.
