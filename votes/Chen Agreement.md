This agreement is a deal made between the current mayoral government (run by Edward), and the Town Member 'spicata'.

### What spicata gets

- All policies and the laws of the town will not apply to spicata, unless it is feasibly impossible to apply it without affecting spicata in some way (e.g. immigration laws affect spicata, but will still be able to put into law).
- spicata remains a member of the Town despite his exemption to Town laws.

### What Edward gets

- spicata will no longer be able to form poltical parties, and any political parties he is in power of at the moment will have to be dissolved/transferred.
    - This goes until the end of the current mayoral goverment.
- spicata will no longer be able to run for any political position in this Town that will provide him with additional powers i.e. the speaker position or the Mayo.
    - This goes until the end of the current mayoral goverment.

## Conditions

- If either party believes the other to not have upheld their side of the agreement, this agreement can be voided.
- This agreement will not carry over to the next mayoral government had Edward's government ever be voted out.
    - This comes with the caveat that it can be carried over if the new mayoral government decides to do so.
